map:
    # If 'chunksize' is provided, each input file gets split into multiple chunks,
    # each mapped separately. Useful for mapping on clusters with many
    # relatively weak nodes.

parse:

    # alignment records in the SAM format (the resulting hybrid between the

    # thorough investigation of Hi-C data. Downstream of parsing, pairsams
    # are split into .pairs and .bam, and .bam alignments are tagged with
    # Hi-C related information. 'make_pairsam' roughly doubles the storage
    # and I/O requirements and should be used only when absolutely needed.

    # called '.pairsam' despite missing SAM alignments, for technical reasons.

    # output of bwa in a .bam format. Could be used as a faster alternative

    # related information is not necessary.

    # Pass extra options to pairtools parse, on top of the ones specified by

# Control how PCR/optical duplicates are detected in the data.
dedup:
    # PCR/optical duplicates are detected as Hi-C pairs with matching locations
